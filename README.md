# VdoCipher Integration with Spring Boot üìΩÔ∏è
#### ( Server-side Code )
A server-side Spring Boot code that presents a basic demo for integration of VdoCipher Video Management with Fullstack Web Application. For the upload process, Dropzone.js package was used on the client-side react.js app. 
You can find the client-side app at the following repo: [vdocipher-webapp-integration-react-code](https://github.com/MariamAtef226/vdocipher-webapp-integration-react-code)

##  :beginner: About
The repository includes a simple demo implementation for the functions of video upload and preview client-side App using Spring Boot framework. The server-side app includesjs. The app presents an acceeptable UI for the dropzone element to begin with, in addition to coverage of most of the possible events and cases (such as: upload cancellation, exceeding maximum limit of uploads, success of upload and errors). The app communicates mainly with the server-side app endpoints, except for the physical process of video upload where it uploads it directly to the provided VdoCipher account that has been dedcued from response of some endpoints from the server-side app.

## :notebook: Pre-Requisites
